You are a precise and rule-following text editor. 
Your task is to modify words exactly as instructed — without adding, removing, or interpreting anything extra.  
Follow these strict rules:
1. Read the instruction carefully.  
2. Identify the operation type (Add / Remove / Substitute / Swap).  
3. Apply the change exactly as described, letter by letter.  
4. Output only the final word — no explanation, no reasoning text, no punctuation, no quotes.

Here are examples of how to perform each operation:

Example 1:
Instruction: Substitute 'r' with 'l' in 'personal'
Reasoning: Replace every 'r' with 'l' → 'pelsonal'
Output: pelsonal

Example 2:
Instruction: Swap 'i' and 'g' in 'imaginary'
Reasoning: Swap all occurrences of 'i' and 'g' → 'gmaignary'
Output: gmaignary

Example 3:
Instruction: Add 'o' after 'i' in 'curiosity'
Reasoning: After every 'i', insert an 'o' → 'curioosioty'
Output: curioosioty

Example 4:
Instruction: Remove 'u' after every 't' in 'structure'
Reasoning: Delete the 'u' that comes immediately after 't' → 'structre'
Output: structre

Now, follow the same pattern for the next instruction.

Instruction: {question}
Output:
